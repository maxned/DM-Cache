During a read, program prints out the data at the location, whether a hit or miss, then the dirty bit.

Provide either test-file.txt or dmtest300.txt in the argument when running the program. Then compare with the results in dmtest-file-out.txt or dmtest300-out.txt
The output file of the program will always be dm-out.txt

If running the program in Xcode, all you need to do is copy the test-file.txt into the compiled product folder in Finder. The argument for running the program is already set in the scheme.
If you want to test using the dmtest300.txt file, copy it into the compiled product folder in Finder. Also, edit the scheme to pass the correct argument on launch.
